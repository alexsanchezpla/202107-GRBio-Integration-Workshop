	abstract = {With the rapid progression of biotechnologies in the last few decades, molecular biology assays have shifted from limited to high throughput. Indeed, we successively witnessed an accelerated development of ‘omics technologies at multiple molecular scales: DNA arrays, DNA methylation screening, proteome-wide interaction screening, Chip-Seq, protein array, next generation sequencing, RNA-seq and next generation protein mass-spectrometry. The availability of large repository of ‘omics data has stimulated the prolific growth of analytical methods for clinical outcome prediction specialized for one type of ‘omics measurement, but comparatively fewer cross-scales ones (2 molecular scales) and very rare multiple scales ones (⩾3 molecular scales; “multiscale”). Of note, abundant original cross-scale and multiscale ‘omics methods have been developed for identifying gene function [1], novel disease-gene [2,3] and diseases’ biomodules (e.g. biomodules of microRNA-mRNA co-expression [4]). However, these approaches are insufficient for predicting clinical outcome of complex disorders [5,6]. Here, we provide a framework to illustrate the difficulty of increasing the accuracy of a clinical outcome predictor from multiple scales of ‘omics data, and position the significance of Kim et al. [7] that appears in this issue of the Journal of Biomedical Informatics. We also include a brief historical perspective of foundational methodologies in cross-scale and multiscale ‘omics analytics (single ‘omics analytics are out of scope of this perspective).},

	abstract = {In the pharmaceutical industry, systems biology is making a paradigm shift in drug discovery from target-focused to a systems approach. It studies the molecular level changes in a biological system as an integrated and interacting network of genes, proteins, and metabolites instead of focusing on individual components. Integrative analysis of molecular level data becomes very important in unraveling the complex relationship and interactions in the biological system. One way to conduct integrative analysis is to identify correlations among genes, proteins, and metabolites. There are various analytic challenges: data preprocessing from various omics platforms; the number of variables much larger than the number of subjects; wide differences in the number of variables per platform leading to imbalance in the platform contributions to the analysis; the issues of multicollinearity and multiple testing; and difficulty in proper model validation to avoid selection bias. This article is a comprehensive review of statistical methods that address analysis challenges in integrative data.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput technologies enable quantitative monitoring of the abundance of various biological molecules and allow determination of their variation between biological states on a genomic scale. Two popular platforms are DNA microarrays that measure messenger RNA transcript levels, and gel-free proteomic analyses that quantify protein abundance. Obviously, no single approach can fully unravel the complexities of fundamental biology and it is equally clear that integrative analysis of multiple levels of gene expression would be valuable in this endeavor. However, most integrative transcriptomic and proteomic studies have thus far either failed to find a correlation or only observed a weak correlation. In addition to various biological factors, it is suggested that the poor correlation could be quite possibly due to the inadequacy of available statistical tools to compensate for biases in the data collection methodologies. To address this issue, attempts have recently been made to systematically investigate the correlation patterns between transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, and to develop sophisticated statistical tools to improve the chances of capturing a relationship. The goal of these efforts is to enhance understanding of the relationship between transcriptomes and proteomes so that integrative analyses may be utilized to reveal new biological insights that are not accessible through one-dimensional datasets. In this review, we outline some of the challenges associated with integrative analyses and present some preliminary statistical solutions. In addition, some new applications of integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to the investigation of post-transcriptional regulation are also discussed.},

Recently, CRC has been reclassified based on molecular analyses of various genes and proteins capable of separating morphologic types of tumors into molecular categories. At the same time, a number of new prognostic and predictive single genes and proteins have been discovered that are designed to reflect sensitivity and/or resistance to existing therapies. Multigene predictors have also been developed to predict the risk of relapse for intermediate-stage CRC after completion of surgical extirpation. More recently, a number of biomarkers tested by a variety of methods have been proposed as specific predictors of chemotherapy and radiotherapy response. Other markers have been successfully used to predict toxic effects of standard therapies. In this review, a series of novel biomarkers are considered and compared with standard-of-care markers for their potential use as pharmacogenomic and pharmacogenetic predictors of disease outcome.},

Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling.},

Among them are gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, copy number variation, and protein-protein/gene-gene interactions. Each of these distinct data types provides a different, partly independent and complementary, view of the whole genome. However, understanding functions of genes, proteins, and other aspects of the genome requires more information than provided by each of the datasets. Integrating data from different sources is, therefore, an important part of current research in genomics and proteomics. Data integration also plays important roles in combining clinical, environmental, and demographic data with high-throughput genomic data. Nevertheless, the concept of data integration is not well defined in the literature and it may mean different things to different researchers. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for integrating genetic, genomic, and proteomic data. The framework captures fundamental aspects of data integration and is developed taking the key steps in genetic, genomic, and proteomic data fusion. Secondly, we provide a review of some of the most commonly used current methods and approaches for combining genomic data with focus on the statistical aspects.},

With the help of computational methods, research in the field of biology and biomedicine has gained tremendous benefits over the past few decades. In the new era of personalized medicine, we will rely more on the assistance of computational analysis. In this paper, we briefly review the generation of multiple omics and their basic characteristics. And then the challenges and opportunities for computational analysis are discussed and some state-of-art analysis methods that were recently proposed by peers for integrative analysis of multiple omics data are reviewed.

	abstract = {Multi-omics studies are believed to provide a more comprehensive picture of a complex biological system than traditional studies with one omics data source. However, from a statistical point of view data integration implies non-trivial challenges. In this review, we highlight recent statistical inference and learning techniques that have been devised in this context. In the first part of our article, we focus on techniques to identify a relevant biological sub-system based on combined omics data. In the second part of our article we ask, in which way integrated omics data could be used for better personalized patient treatment in a supervised as well as unsupervised learning setting. Different classes of algorithms are discussed for both application tasks. Existing and future challenges for data integration methods are pointed out.},

The integrative methods can collectively mine multiple types of biological data and produce more holistic, systems-level biological insights. We survey recent methods for collective mining (integration) of various types of networked biological data. We compare different state-of-the-art methods for data integration and highlight their advantages and disadvantages in addressing important biological problems. We identify the important computational challenges of these methods and provide a general guideline for which methods are suited for specific biological problems, or specific data types. Moreover, we propose that recent non-negative matrix factorization-based approaches may become the integration methodology of choice, as they are well suited and accurate in dealing with heterogeneous data and have many opportunities for further development.},

	abstract = {Due to rapid technological advances, various types of genomic and proteomic data with different sizes, formats, and structures have become available. Among them are gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, copy number variation, and protein-protein/gene-gene interactions. Each of these distinct data types provides a different, partly independent and complementary, view of the whole genome. However, understanding functions of genes, proteins, and other aspects of the genome requires more information than provided by each of the datasets. Integrating data from different sources is, therefore, an important part of current research in genomics and proteomics. Data integration also plays important roles in combining clinical, environmental, and demographic data with high-throughput genomic data.  Nevertheless, the concept of data integration is not well defined in the literature and it may mean different things to different researchers. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for integrating genetic, genomic, and proteomic data. The framework captures fundamental aspects of data integration and is developed taking the key steps in genetic, genomic, and proteomic data fusion. Secondly, we provide a review of some of the most commonly used current methods and approaches for combining genomic data with focus on the statistical aspects.},

This interaction is guided by sequence complentarity and results in the reduction of mRNA and/or protein levels. miRNAs are involved in key biological processes and different diseases. Therefore, deciphering miRNA targets is crucial for diagnostics and therapeutics. However, miRNA regulatory mechanisms are complex and there is still no high-throughput and low-cost miRNA target screening technique. In recent years, several computational methods based on sequence complementarity of the miRNA and the mRNAs have been developed. However, the predicted interactions using these computational methods are inconsistent and the expected false positive rates are still large. Recently, it has been proposed to use the expression values of miRNAs and mRNAs (and/or proteins) to refine the results of sequence-based putative targets for a particular experiment. These methods have shown to be effective identifying the most prominent interactions from the databases of putative targets. Here, we review these methods that combine both expression and sequence-based putative targets to predict miRNA targets.},

First, we have the opportunity to obtain a more precise and accurate estimate of expression levels than using the individual platforms alone. Second, the combined measure simplifies downstream analysis by eliminating the need to work with three sets of expression measures and to consolidate results from the three platforms. We propose to use factor analysis (FA) to obtain a unified gene expression measure (UE) from multiple platforms. The UE is a weighted average of the three platforms, and is shown to perform well in terms of accuracy and precision. In addition, the FA model produces parameter estimates that allow the assessment of the model fit. The R code is provided in File S2.

This study aimed to improve microRNA target predictions in a given biological context, using in silico predictions, microRNA and mRNA expression. We used target prediction tools to produce lists of predicted targets and used a gene set test designed to detect consistent effects of microRNAs on the joint expression of multiple targets. In a single test, association between microRNA expression and target gene set expression as well as the contribution of the individual target genes on the association are determined. The strongest negatively associated mRNAs as measured by the test were prioritized. We applied our integration method to a well-defined muscle differentiation model. Validation of our predictions in C2C12 cells confirmed predicted targets of known as well as novel muscle-related microRNAs. We further studied associations between microRNA–mRNA pairs in human prostate cancer, finding some pairs that have been recently experimentally validated by others. Using the same study, we showed the advantages of the global test over Pearson correlation and lasso. We conclude that our integrated approach successfully identifies regulated microRNAs and their targets.},

	abstract = {miRNAs are small RNA molecules ('22 nt) that interact with their target mRNAs inhibiting translation or/and cleavaging the target mRNA. This interaction is guided by sequence complentarity and results in the reduction of mRNA and/or protein levels. miRNAs are involved in key biological processes and different diseases. Therefore, deciphering miRNA targets is crucial for diagnostics and therapeutics. However, miRNA regulatory mechanisms are complex and there is still no high-throughput and low-cost miRNA target screening technique. In recent years, several computational methods based on sequence complementarity of the miRNA and the mRNAs have been developed. However, the predicted interactions using these computational methods are inconsistent and the expected false positive rates are still large. Recently, it has been proposed to use the expression values of miRNAs and mRNAs (and/or proteins) to refine the results of sequence-based putative targets for a particular experiment. These methods have shown to be effective identifying the most prominent interactions from the databases of putative targets. Here, we review these methods that combine both expression and sequence-based putative targets to predict miRNA targets.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through mRNA degradation and/or translation repression, affecting many biological processes. DIANA-microT web server (http://www.microrna.gr/webServer) is dedicated to miRNA target prediction/functional analysis, and it is being widely used from the scientific community, since its initial launch in 2009. DIANA-microT v5.0, the new version of the microT server, has been significantly enhanced with an improved target prediction algorithm, DIANA-microT-CDS. It has been updated to incorporate miRBase version 18 and Ensembl version 69. The in silico-predicted miRNA-gene interactions in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans exceed 11 million in total. The web server was completely redesigned, to host a series of sophisticated workflows, which can be used directly from the on-line web interface, enabling users without the necessary bioinformatics infrastructure to perform advanced multi-step functional miRNA analyses. For instance, one available pipeline performs miRNA target prediction using different thresholds and meta-analysis statistics, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. DIANA-microT web server v5.0 also supports a complete integration with the Taverna Workflow Management System (WMS), using the in-house developed DIANA-Taverna Plug-in. This plug-in provides ready-to-use modules for miRNA target prediction and functional analysis, which can be used to form advanced high-throughput analysis pipelines.},

We reviewed the biomedical literature for translational platforms allowing the management and exploration of clinical and omics data, and identified seven platforms: BRISK, caTRIP, cBio Cancer Portal, G-DOC, iCOD, iDASH and tranSMART. We analyzed these platforms along seven major axes. (1) The community axis regrouped information regarding initiators and funders of the project, as well as availability status and references. (2) We regrouped under the information content axis the nature of the clinical and omics data handled by each system. (3) The privacy management environment axis encompassed functionalities allowing control over data privacy. (4) In the analysis support axis, we detailed the analytical and statistical tools provided by the platforms. We also explored (5) interoperability support and (6) system requirements. The final axis (7) platform support listed the availability of documentation and installation procedures. A large heterogeneity was observed in regard to the capability to manage phenotype information in addition to omics data, their security and interoperability features. The analytical and visualization features strongly depend on the considered platform. Similarly, the availability of the systems is variable. This review aims at providing the reader with the background to choose the platform best suited to their needs. To conclude, we discuss the desiderata for optimal translational research platforms, in terms of privacy, interoperability and technical features.},
