# The importance of Data 

## Data is essential to solve problems or answer questions

- Simplistically, when we wish to solve a problem we collect data

    - Statistics:     Questions --> [Hypothesis] --> Get data
    - Data Science:   Questions --> Get Data

- Data availability and complexity increases all the time

    - More (Big) data --> Better solutions? 
    
- 21st century holy grial:

    - __Data + AI --> Personalized medicine__
    
<!-- --- -->

<!-- # How did we get here? -->

<!-- - First we took traditional approach -->

<!-- - Then we made the leap into microarrays -->

<!-- - Next we moved into-multi-omics -->

<!-- - Now we look forward to combining it with clinical data -->

# Data-Centric Projects have become key

- The need to have multimodal data, including omics data, images, and clinical data <br>
has driven a multitude of __Research Projects__ <br>

- Their first or ultimate objective is to _facilitate the path to personalized medicine_ through:
.pull-left[

  - data integration 
  - data sharing, 
  - data exchange (OMOP, HL7)
  - data FAIRification,
  - cloud computing and 
  - (federated) data analysis,<br>
among others.

- This represents an _unprecedented opportunity_.
- But requires the right people and knowledge.

# Integrative Omics Data Analysis

---

# The goal(s) of Integrative Omics

- The idea that efficient integration of data from different OMICS can facilitate the discovery of true causes and states of disease has pervaded the biomedical community.

- The general gol of integrative analysis is the _deciphering of complex biological relationships (CBP)_ empowered by the _combined use of distinct pieces of information_ that represent a, probably partial, view of the _different levels at which these processes happen_.

- More specifically integrative omics data anlysis is applied for
    - Disease subtyping,
    - Disease insights,
    - Biomarker development,
    - Combination with non-omics

# When a single omics is not enough

- Ideally matrix factorizations can provide dimension-reduced
data visualizations that help detect distinct patterns in
features or samples.

- Sometimes the information in the data does not allow for this
separation, but _extending the factorization to different omics that can be related differently with the latent factors can do the job_.

- As could be expected there exist many ways to do multiple factorization.

  - Multiple Factor Analysis, 
  - Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis, 
  - Multiple Coinertia Analysis, ...

# A Colon Cancer Example

- A set of 121 tumors from the TCGA (Weinstein, Collisson, Mills, et al. 2013) colorectal cancer cohort is analyzed. 

- The tumors have been profiled for 
    - gene expression using RNA-seq,
    - mutations using Exome-seq, and 
    - copy number variations using genotyping arrays.
    
- Although two tumors arise in the colon, they may have distinct molecular profiles, which is important for treatment decisions.
- The subset of tumors used in this chapter belong to two distinct molecular subtypes CMS1, CMS3

# Summary part I

- Biological Processes are complex and they are "probably" better revealed using distinct sources of information.

- While there are many approache for the integrative analysis there is no universal "IODA" method.

  - Many families of many types of methods available: Need to be related, classified, filtered, benchmarked.
  - In many situations biology must guide the analysis
  - All data are not equally informative and it is often the case that some omics dominate others. : "Gene expression and _what else_?"

# Insights in Multi-Group Data Analysis
### Carolina Millapan, Ferran R., Esteban V.

### Multigroup PCA

- __Multigroup Principal Component Analysis__ 

  - Aim:  _maximization of the interdistances between the points of the different groups_.

- __Multi-Group Dimension reduction__

  - Aim: find an orthogonal set of vectors such that each vector v tends to avoid that the projections of the observations of a given group do not overlap the centroids of the projections of the observations of each of the remaining
groups.

# Precision or Personalized Medicine

- Two patients with the same disease can respond very differently to the same treatment. 

- Why? Mainly due to the different genomic characteristics of each one. 

- Precision or Personalized Medicine aims at helping physicians to select the treatments that are most likely to help patients based on their genetics.

- PM is currently experiencing significant advances due to the appearance of new diagnostic and computer methods that provide an understanding of the molecular bases of the disease, particularly of the genomics. 

---

# Personalized Medicine at a Scale

## The need for a paradigm change

- Until recently, PM  has been associated with experimental therapies _far from daily clinical practice_ 

- But its central elements arae now much easier to reach:

  - Increasing availability of Genomic Data, fast and cheap to produce
  - Increasing computing power in-house or in the cloud (EOSC)
  - Possibility of accessing clinical data in anonymized possibly federated ways
  
- Having the ability to __integrate__ genomic, clinical and other social, environmental and behavioral factors, will (should) lead to a transformation in the way in which decisions are made with direct effect on clinical practice and public health measures.
  <!-- - improving diagnosis,  -->
  <!-- - improving treatments or  -->
  <!-- - increasing the ability to predict the development of diseases. -->

- The ultimate goal is a safer, more efficient, preventive, and predictive medicine. 

---

# How will this be done (in Spain)

## The IMPaCT program

- In mid-September 2020, the Council of Ministers approved the call for granting grants for the __Precision Medicine Infrastructure associated with Science and Technology__ (__IMPaCT__) of the Strategic Action in Health 2017-2020.

- This decision, which involved the granting of 25.8 million euros to the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII)

- The programs included in IMPaCT are aligned with several areas that will be developed in the future national strategy:

  - Predictive medicine; 
  - Genomic medicine and 
  - Data science. 
  
---

# The Predictive Medicine Program

.pull-left[

- Aimed at the design and implementation of _a large population cohort with clinical, epidemiological and biological data, measured at the individual level_, 

- which allows representing the entire population residing in Spain, 

- including the ethnic variability and geographic and environmental diversity.

- __Data sharing__ is an essential aspect: clinical data needs to be accessible for this program to be possible.

<!-- This will make it possible to build predictive models of disease, identify health inequalities, monitor key indicators and evaluate the impact of health policies ”, continued Raquel Yotti. -->

- It will develop _coordination infrastructures and protocols_ to carry out genomic analyzes and other 'omic' data in an effective, efficient and equitable accessible manner.

- It will take as support large research centers that already have of state-of-the-art sequencing technology and experience in its application to the diagnosis of human diseases. 

- It will optimize and reinforce the available massive sequencing capacities, orienting them to the needs of genetic diagnosis -exomes, complete genomes, etc.-

# The Data Science Program

- _Develop a system for the collection, integration and analysis of clinical and molecular data__
aimed at improving the health of each individual patient, and 

- Which allows the secondary use of existing information in the SNS to the benefit of society with the objectives of public health, health planning and research. 

- Its objective is to __optimize the management of the information generated__, in order to apply it in the most effective way for the population and the SNS. 

- It will provide 

  - _bioinformatics tools_ for the management of genomic data and 
  - _medical informatics_ solutions for the _management_ and _integration_ of clinical data, 
  
facilitating the interoperability of the clinical information systems of the different autonomous health systems.

# Looking ahead

- The analysis of Omics Data is an example of fruitful development between Statistics and Biological (Health) Sciences.

- As more data is becoming available some therapeutical possibilities approach reality.

- While Statistics will always be relevant to guide this approach other skills become important.

- We must, at least, be aware of these skills and the problems they address because this is really an unprecedent opportunity.
